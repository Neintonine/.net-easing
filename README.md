# .NET Easing

A simple and barebone class/"library", that adds the most common easing functions.

### Disclamer
None of the mathematical functions came from me. They all came from the awesome work from
[Andrey Sitnik](https://sitnik.ru/) and [Ivan Solovev](https://solovev.one/) over at https://easings.net/#.

I just added them to C#.


### Requirements
- .NET 6+

### Installation
You can use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NETEasing) to add this class as a module. This will allow additional updates if necessary.

You obviously have the option to download the CS files and use them as is in your project. In that way you are free to change them as you like.

### Support
If you wish to add a new easing function, you are free to create a fork and pull request.
